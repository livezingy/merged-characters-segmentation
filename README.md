1.This repository created in C# VS2013-x64, It contains the following function:
* merged characters segmentation algorithm according "The Robustness of “Connecting Characters Together” CAPTCHAs". 
* Sauvola binarization
* OTSU binarization
* Iteration binarization
* Zhang-Suen skeletonization

2.The test data set is the TAOBAO CAPTCHA that composed of blue character and white background. 

3.Get more information about the algorithm from http://livezingy.com/the-theory-of-segmentation-for-merged-characters/
